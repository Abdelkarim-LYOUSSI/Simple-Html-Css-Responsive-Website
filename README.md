# Simple-Html-Css-Responsive-Website
This is a simple website I've created to show my humble WebDev capabilities.
It promotes a fictive Logistic Company called International Logistics, showing its services and experties as well as an About page to introduce itself to potential customers. 
I hope that you will like the interface, color scheme and mainly its responsive effects.
